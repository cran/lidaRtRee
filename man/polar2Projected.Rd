  x,
  y,
  z = 0,
  azimuth,
  dist,
  slope = 0,
  declination = 0,
  convergence = 0,

\arguments{
\item{x}{vector. easting coordinates of centers in meter}

\item{y}{vector. northing coordinates of centers in meter}

\item{z}{vector. altitudes of centers in meters}

\item{azimuth}{vector. azimuth values from centers in radian}

\item{dist}{vector. distances between centers and objects in meter}

\item{slope}{vector. slope values from centers in radian}

\item{declination}{vector. magnetic declination values in radian}

\item{convergence}{vector. meridian convergence values in radian}

\item{diameter}{vector. diameters in meter (e.g. in case a radius should be added to the distance)}
}
\value{
A data.frame with easting, northing and altitude coordinates, and horizontal distance from centers to objects centers
}
\description{
Computes projected coordinates (Easting, Northing, Altitude) from polar coordinates (Azimuth, Slope, Distance) and center position (Easting, Northing, Altitude). Magnetic declination and meridian convergence are optional parameters. In case distance is measured to the border of objects (e.g. trees), the diameter can be added to compute the coordinates of object center.
